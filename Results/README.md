# Results Overview

This folder contains the key visualizations and results derived from the **UC-HSI datasets** and the **HyperConvFormer** model, as described in the paper  
**"UC-HSI: UAV-Based Crop Hyperspectral Imaging Datasets and Machine Learning Benchmark Results" (IEEE GRSL 2024).**

## Figures and Descriptions

### **Fig. 1: NIQE and Reflectance Comparison**
![Fig 1](1.gif)  
This figure compares **noisy vs. denoised HSI data** using NIQE score plots (top) and canopy spectra (bottom). Denoising (FastHyDe) improves spectral smoothness and reduces noise, especially at the spectrum boundaries.



### **Fig. 2: Crop Dataset Class Distribution**
![Fig 2](2.gif)  
Displays the distribution of HSI samples across **10 crop categories**. It shows the number of patch samples and images per class, ensuring balanced training and testing datasets.



### **Fig. 3: Representative Canopy Spectra**
![Fig 3](3.gif)  
Shows **spectral reflectance curves** of 10 crop types (cereals and legumes), captured in the 385â€“1021 nm range. Each curve highlights unique spectral signatures that distinguish crop varieties.



### **Fig. 4: Growth Stage Dataset Summary**
![Fig 4](4.gif)  
Highlights the dataset statistics for **sorghum and groundnut growth stages**, covering 5 key stages: vegetative, flowering initiation, peg/milk, grain filling, and maturity.



### **Fig. 5: Crop-Type Classification Results**
![Fig 5](5.gif)  
A table comparing **classification accuracy (OA, AA, Kappa)** of different ML and DL models (SVM, 3D CNN, ViT, SpectralFormer) on the crop category dataset.



### **Fig. 6: Growth Stage Classification Performance**
![Fig 6](6.gif)  
Shows benchmark results for **growth stage classification** of sorghum and groundnut datasets, comparing the performance of multiple baseline models.



### **Fig. 7: Overall Accuracy Comparison Across Models**
![Fig 7](7.gif)  
A bar chart illustrating the **overall accuracy (OA)** of HyperConvFormer vs. baseline models on crop category and growth stage datasets. HyperConvFormer consistently outperforms others.
