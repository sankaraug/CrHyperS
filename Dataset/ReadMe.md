# UC-HSI Dataset Description

The **UC-HSI (UAV-based Crop Hyperspectral Imaging) dataset** is a curated collection of high-resolution hyperspectral images captured using a UAV platform. It was created to provide detailed spectral and spatial information of various agricultural crops, enabling advanced studies in crop monitoring, classification, and growth analysis. The dataset was collected during the **post-rainy season of 2021â€“2022** in the experimental fields of the **International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Hyderabad, India**.

The hyperspectral images cover a spectral range of **385â€“1021 nm** with **300 narrow bands** at a spectral resolution of **2.1 nm**. Images were captured at an approximate **spatial resolution of 1.1 cm per pixel**, ensuring fine-grained canopy-level observations. The UAV platform used was a **DJI Matrice-600 Pro**, equipped with a **Resonon Pika-L hyperspectral camera**, GPS/INS system, and radiometric calibration panels to ensure accurate reflectance data.

The **UC-HSI Crop Category Dataset** includes hyperspectral cubes for **10 crop types**, each with multiple genotype varieties. The crops included are:

- Sorghum
- Pearl Millet
- Maize
- Groundnut
- Cowpea
- Common Bean
- Lima Bean
- Mung Bean
- Chickpea
- Pigeon Pea

The dataset comprises **886 hyperspectral images** and **69,514 labeled 3D patches** of size **11 Ã— 11 Ã— 300**. These images are provided with separate training and testing splits:

- **Training Images:** 533  
- **Testing Images:** 353  
- **Training Samples:** 39,754  
- **Testing Samples:** 29,760

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** Currently, we are providing access to **only a portion of the dataset**.
